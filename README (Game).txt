The game i want to mak is Asteroids. I remmeber playing it a lot when i was a child and i reckon it would be very fun to make.
First of all i intend to make the ship. I'll draw it myself instead of using a sprite.
The second step would be to make a cool image for the background.
And lastly i will implement the asteroids, ammo, explosions etc.
